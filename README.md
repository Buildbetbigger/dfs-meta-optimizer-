# DFS Meta-Optimizer

## üéØ Overview

A revolutionary Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) optimization system that goes beyond traditional point maximization to focus on **beating the field**. This professional-grade platform combines opponent modeling, AI-powered analysis, genetic algorithms, portfolio optimization, and real-time data integration to provide genuine competitive advantages in DFS contests.

**What makes this different:** Traditional optimizers find lineups with the highest projected points. This meta-optimizer finds lineups with the highest probability of finishing in the money by predicting and exploiting field behavior, calculating leverage, and building strategically differentiated portfolios.

## üìà Key Metrics Explained

### Leverage Score
```
Leverage = (Ceiling Points / Ownership %) √ó 100
```
**What it means:** Tournament-winning upside relative to ownership. High leverage = big ceiling with low popularity.

**Example:** 
- Player A: 45 ceiling, 25% owned ‚Üí Leverage = 180
- Player B: 40 ceiling, 8% owned ‚Üí Leverage = 500 (better tournament play)

### Uniqueness Score
```
Uniqueness = 100 - Average Ownership %
```
**What it means:** How differentiated your lineup is from the field. Higher = more contrarian.

**Target:** 
- Cash games: 60-70 (somewhat unique)
- GPPs: 80-90 (very unique)

### Expected Value (EV)
```
EV = (Win Probability √ó Prize) - Entry Fee
```
**What it means:** Long-term expected profit per entry. Positive EV = profitable in the long run.

### Correlation Score
```
Correlation = Sum of Player Pair Correlations
```
**What it means:** How much your players' performances are linked. QB + his receivers = high correlation (good for GPPs).

7. **Adjust ownership predictions** if major news breaks

### Pre-Lock Final Check (1 Hour Before)

8. **Final data refresh** (all sources)
9. **Re-optimize if needed** (major injury/news)
10. **Run simulation** on final portfolio (Monte Carlo)
11. **Export lineups** for DraftKings upload
12. **Select optimal contests** based on EV analysis

## üéì Strategy Tips

### Leverage-First Approach
1. Identify high leverage plays (low owned, high ceiling)
2. Build around 2-3 leverage cornerstone plays
3. Balance with safe floor players
4. Target 80-85 uniqueness score

### Stack Heavy Strategy
1. Start with QB + 2 pass catchers from same team
2. Add bring-back from opponent (game stack)
3. Fill with correlated pieces
4. Best for high-variance GPPs

### Anti-Chalk Portfolio
1. Fade 2-3 highest owned players (>35%)
2. Build differentiated player pool
3. Generate 20-150 unique entries
4. Target top-heavy payout structures

### Balanced Cash Game
1. Use cash mode in Module 2
2. Minimize variance with floor-focused players
3. Single entry or 2-3 max
4. Target 65-70% win rate over time
