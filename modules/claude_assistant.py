**Consider These DFS Psychology Factors:**

1. **Salary Tier Analysis:**
   - Is this player expensive ($9K+), mid-tier ($6-9K), or value ($<6K)?
   - Expensive players: typically 25-40% owned
   - Mid-tier: typically 15-30% owned
   - Value players: typically 5-20% owned

2. **Position-Specific Ownership:**
   - QBs: Generally highest owned (30-45% for top options)
   - Top TEs/WRs: Moderate-high owned (20-35%)
   - RBs in showdown: Varies widely (10-30%)
   - Value plays: Low owned (5-15%)

3. **Team and Matchup Context:**
   - Is this team favored or an underdog?
   - High-scoring game expected or defensive struggle?

4. **Value Score Impact:**
   - High value (>2.5 pts/$1K) = typically attracts more ownership
   - Low value (<2.0 pts/$1K) = typically lower owned

**CRITICAL:** Your prediction must be SPECIFIC to this player's situation. 
DO NOT give generic predictions. Consider their exact salary, position, team, and value.
